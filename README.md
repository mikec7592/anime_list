# anime_list

## My First Full-Stack(CRUD) APP 
Hosted on heroku accesible here --> [anime_list](https://boiling-basin-25566.herokuapp.com/)

### Why I decided to go with this concept
I am and always have been an anime nerd.  When I was younger I always wanted a way to catalog all the anime that I'd watched but at the time i didn't know of any resources that made that process easy.  Of course as time passed many resources were released that catered to my need.  This is simply my take on something that I love.

##### APP Highlights:
- 7 Restful Routes
- Sign up/log in functionality, with encrypted passwords with some authorization flow
- EJS Partials
- Super light Skeleton framework


### How It's Used
Created to catalog and track all animes you've completed, plan to watch or are currently watching.  Ratings can be included on a 1 - 10 scale as well as a brief descrption of the anime.  Favorites list coming soon!

### Notes for future development 
- Finish implementing relationship functionality in order for users to create a favorites list
- Add a landing page 
- fix/add styling
- implement models that highlight when a user adds a favorite
